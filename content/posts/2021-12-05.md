Requirements: 
1. Create new product template 'product.New-Product-Template.liquid' in the /templates directory

After creating a new product template, preview your theme and navigate to the product page. At the end of your url add the following - ```?view=New-Product-Template/```

Your entire url should look something like this - ```https://domain.myshopify.com/products/product-title?view=New-Product-Template/```

This is an easy way to preview your new product template without changing a products template file inside the Shopify admin. This is also very useful for A/B testing, more on this soon!
