This is a redesign of the Shopify product page and an added price calculator / estimator for the their Affirm financing service.

I also changed the plus and minus (+/-) indicators on the quantity selector to be positioned on the left and right side of the input window.

This product also requires "Add-ons", other products that can be added to the main product as a group purchase, this is great for warranties or products with refillables.

### **Before -**

### **After -**

The price calculator calculates two different prices. The total price and the estimated monthly price the product would cost if Affirm financing service is used.
