## Does your restaurant need contact tracing?

The state of Michigan just changed the rules for Restaurants starting November 2, 2020. All guests will be required to give their name and contact information. 

If you are like many other restaurants you might not be prepared to accommodate this change. That's where I come in!

**I'm offering free contact tracing set up for any restaurant in Michigan.**

## What does this included?

1. I will give you a QR code, just like the one you see here (Give it a scan!). Post this QR in your restaurant for guests to scan. 
2. Guests will be redirected to a form that asks for their name, date and basic contact information. 
3. This information will be stored in a database and retrievable at any time.



Send me a message or give me a call and we can get your contact tracing set up! This is a no strings attached offer, you pay nothing for this service.
